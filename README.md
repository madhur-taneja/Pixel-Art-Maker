## Getting Started

The primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

The starter code can be found in [this](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter) repo provided by Udacity. 

The project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/641/view)

This is how the canvas will look:
